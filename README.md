CRP/Albumin ratio is an index reflecting both inflammation and nutrition status. And it has proved to be an important predictor for inflammation, malignant tumors, and other conditions.
However, there was limited evidence for ICU patients. 
Therefore, we put forward our hypothesis
1. Is the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio an independent predictor of mortality in ICU patients?
2. Does the addition of CRP/albumin ratio in the APACHE IV score improve the diagnosis precision?

We conducted three scientific and important research designs to verify the hypothesis step by step.
The first part is a matched case-control study. 
For the second step, we validated the association in a retrospective cohort study which consisted of 2784 participants. 
For the last and important step, we want to testify the increase of diagnosis efficiency of this ratio for early screening.  

Here is the brief introduction of our team-Team Six. The research topic of our team is ‘C-Reactive Protein/Albumin Ratio is an Independent Predictor of Mortality in ICU patients’ ,our team leader is Miao Liu, team member included Shanshan Yang; Shengshu Wang; Wangping Jia; Wenze Cao; Ke Han; Ke Jiang; Zeyu Jiang; Wanlin Zhao; Shen Qi; Jinxiu Sun; Yun Hua. The unique characteristics of Team Six is a dozen of pretty and handsome youth combing medical and engineering make the team become a Multi-field talents from different enterprises interdisciplinary cooperation unit. Hope you are interested in our project and give us a chance let us show you how far we could go！
